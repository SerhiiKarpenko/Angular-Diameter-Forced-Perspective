# Overview
This project is inspired by the game Superliminal and its mind-blowing Forced Perspective mechanic.

Forced perspective, as seen in the game Superliminal, is a mechanic that manipulates perception by altering the size and distance of objects in relation to the player's viewpoint. It creates mind-bending illusions where objects can appear larger or smaller depending on their placement in the game world. This mechanic adds a surreal and puzzling element to the gameplay, challenging players to think creatively and use perspective to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles.
